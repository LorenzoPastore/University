# Neural-Network-Hyperparameters-Optimization
The purpose of this project is the optimization of the hyperparameters of a neural network, with the objective to maximize the value of the accuracy on a 10 fold cross validation.


The notebook was developed in GoogleColab with the help of the GPU accelerator (edit>notebook settings>hardware accelerator). It is therefore advisable to play it in the same conditions.
